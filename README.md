## Preleminary Round

### ðŸŽ¯ Objectives for Preliminary Round:

1. Produce a functional ML model (with HMM or NLP)
2. Build a Streamlit prototype demonstrating the model
3. Prepare a clear, engaging presentation

### ðŸ“… Timeline and Task Distribution (5 Days)

#### ðŸš© Day 1: Project Kickoff and Data Exploration

All members (Team Members 1-5):

Morning:

- Understand clearly the problem statement, success criteria, and data sources.
- Set up collaborative environment (GitHub/GitLab repository, communication channels).

Afternoon:

- Collect and preprocess initial data from CryptoQuant, Glassnode, Coinglass.
- Explore the data thoroughly, identify initial potential market indicators or signals.

Evening (brief check-in):

- Share insights, finalize data exploration findings.

#### ðŸš© Day 2: Model Building & Initial Backtesting

Team Member 1 & 2:

- Develop initial ML model (HMM-based or NLP-based for sentiment) for generating trading signals.

Team Member 3:

- Set up robust backtesting infrastructure for evaluating strategies (Backtrader, custom scripts).

Team Member 4 & 5:

- Refine data preprocessing pipelines, automate data collection/update process.
- Assist in feature engineering, supporting Team Members 1-3.

End of Day Deliverable:

- Simple baseline model tested and ready for refinement.

#### ðŸš© Day 3: Model Optimization and Trading Strategy Refinement

Team Member 1 & 2:

- Optimize ML model parameters (hyperparameter tuning, cross-validation).
- Improve modelâ€™s signal generation accuracy (target Sharpe Ratio â‰¥ 1.8, MDD â‰¥ -40%).

Team Member 3:

- Run extensive backtests on multiple years of data, document performance clearly.

Team Member 4 & 5:

- Fine-tune strategy rules (when to enter/exit trades, risk management).
- Validate trading frequency requirement (â‰¥ 3% signals per data row).

End of Day Deliverable:

- Finalized ML model & strategy meeting preliminary round performance criteria.

#### ðŸš© Day 4: Start Prototype Development and Presentation Preparation

- Team Member 4 & 5: (Prototype and Presentation Team)
- Team Member 4:
- Initiate Streamlit prototype setup.
- Build front-end visuals (charts, model outputs, strategy performance visuals).

Team Member 5:

- Prepare preliminary slide deck (problem statement, innovation, methodology).
- Draft narrative (introduction, model innovation, impact potential).

Team Member 1, 2 & 3: (Model Fine-Tuning Team)

- Run further performance optimization and forward tests on unseen data.
- Thoroughly document methodology, assumptions, validation processes.
- Ensure scalability, clarity, and reproducibility of the ML pipeline.

Evening Check-in:

- Discuss progress, ensure alignment between model, prototype, and slides.

#### ðŸš© Day 5: Prototype Finalization, Presentation Polishing, and Submission

Team Member 4 & 5 (Prototype and Presentation Team):

Morning:

- Finalize Streamlit app (visual polish, clear user interface, deploy/share prototype link).

Afternoon:

- Polish presentation deck (clear, concise, visually appealing).
- Practice pitch narrative clearly highlighting innovation, methodology, impact, and results.

Evening:

- Integrate latest model results into presentation.

Team Member 1, 2 & 3 (Model Fine-Tuning Team):

Morning:

- Final robustness checks on the ML model and documented backtests.

Afternoon:

- Support prototype team by providing clearly visualized results/data insights.
- Confirm all documentation (data preprocessing, model methodology, backtest validation) is thorough and ready.

Evening:

- Review and approve final model and documentation.
- All members (Final hour):

Final combined team meeting.

- Conduct practice pitch (simulate judging scenario).
- Confirm final deliverables ready:
- ML Model (GitHub Repository) clearly documented and reproducible.
- Streamlit Prototype fully functional and visually appealing.
- Slide Presentation clearly structured and compelling.

### ðŸš€ Final Preliminary Round Deliverables:

- ML Model & Trading Strategy (GitHub repository)
- Functional Streamlit Prototype (hosted and accessible online)
- Concise, Engaging Presentation highlighting the innovation, impact, and success of your solution
